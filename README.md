# GUI Drawing Framework based on the Qt for Python (PySide2) API.

This Python script contains the main classes and functions needed to write a graphical user interface employing the **Qt for Python** API.

The Qt graphics framework always consits of a scene wich contains some graphics items and a view on the scene (i.e. zoom, pan, etc.). Obviously, there can be more than one scene.
The basic building blocks of such a *Graphics View Framework* are implemented in the script. It can be used as a starting point for new drawing GUIs.
